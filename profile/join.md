# Join Allianz Organization

Open GIAM and search for "Allianz Open Source." Order this group and send a friendly reminder to christoph.held@allianz.de for approval. It might take up to a couple of days until you receive an invitation to join the GitHub organization.

Every user might have an auto-generated GitHub user (e.g., JOE-DOE_allianz). These users are so-called Github Enterprise Managed Users (EMU). Please note that it is not possible to use this user for open source contributions. Instead, for work-related open source contributions, utilize your existing personal GitHub account. This aligns with best practices, similar, for example, to Google's open source [recommendations](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/github/accounts#which). Ensure you add your Allianz email to your GitHub account and use it in your git commit to identify your contributions in the context of the company.
